# Viossa

This is a prototype for viossa.net

Viossa is an international conlang pidget language. You can learn more by running thew code!

## Getting Started

First, run the development server. I used Bun, but you can use anything you want:

```bash
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically load [Noto Sans](https://fonts.google.com/noto), and uses [Material Symbols](https://fonts.google.com/icons) for icons.

## Deployment

As always, the easiest way to deploy any Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js themselves.
