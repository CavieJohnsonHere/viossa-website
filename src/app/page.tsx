          Viossa is a community-created artificial pidgin language, created to
          simulate the formation of natural pidgin languages. Viossa is
          characterized by its lack of standardization, with each speaker
          developing a personal idiolect. Spelling and pronunciation can vary
          greatly, and serve as a form of personal self-expression. Viossa is
          learnt and taught entirely by immersion — translation is prohibited
          while learning.
